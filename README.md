# 👨🏻‍💻 Dotfiles

My slow attempt to formalise all the tweaks I end up making to each machine
I set up. Very much a work in progress.

## Setup

### Clone Repo

```bash
cd && git clone git@github.com:jamesrwhite/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

The above will clone it in `$HOME/.dotfiles`

### Run Setup

```bash
make setup
```

This assumes the repo was cloned to `$HOME/.dotfiles`, if it wasn't you can pass
the `location=/path/to/dotfiles` argument.

### Mac Settings

> TODO: look into automating these

- move doc to left
- hide applications holder in dock
- right click on mouse
- invert scroll on trackpad
- double tap to right click on trackpad
- turn dock hiding on
- system wide dark mode
- minimise to dock using scale
- minimise windows into app window
- don't show recent apps in dock

### VS Code

- Setting Sync
